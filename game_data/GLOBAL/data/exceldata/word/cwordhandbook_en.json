She made a detection device that gave an alarm to wake up Kyphon once it detected Kyphon was sleeping by the River of the Underworld. \n\nAnyway, the two had a long-running feud with each other so upon hearing that the soul reaping incident in Chrono Tower might be related to Goorveig, the slack Kyphon took the unusual step of volunteering to arrest Goorveig. \n\nIt's more like seeking revenge than being responsible."
